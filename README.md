# Elm-Backpack-Revist
Revisit of DT project.
Original Code: Group 15, Fall 2019.
Initial Commit: Clone of old code, version submitted via avenue.

## Current functionality
The prototype appears to be able to algorithmically solve user inputted problems.
Remove button removes last item entered correctly.
Previous/Next now works. (Step by step)

## todo
Restructure the HTML.

Table lineup. Possibly table interactivity. Highlighting. Algorithmic output box. ETC

Make solution more clear. 

Switch removal type to selectable or changeable.

CSS so things look nicer.

NOTE: IF WHEN COMPILING IT GIVES VERSION ERROR, EITHER UPDATE OR BOOTLEG IT BY GOING INTO THE .json AND MODIFYING THE VERSION
