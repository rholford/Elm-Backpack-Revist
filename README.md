# Elm-Backpack-Revist
Revisit of DT project.
Original Code: Group 15, Fall 2019.
Initial Commit: Clone of old code, version submitted via avenue.

## Current functionality
The prototype appears to be able to algorithmically solve user inputted problems. (Changes below)

Remove button removes last item entered correctly.

Previous/Next now works. (Step by step)

Enable/Disable Buttons based on usability.

Removal button now can change position of removal.

Solve/steps bug fixed.

Added visible step counter.

Output is now an html table, and not a string. Fixes structuring/alignment for double digit and above outputs.

Step counter changes to display maximum value (ie solution) once completed.

Table actually looks like a table, now.

## Ideas?

File cleanup?

More table tweaks? 

Algorithim steps? Show what's "taken" or something?

Look into classes + standalone CSS?

Is interactivity possible/practical? 

NOTE: IF WHEN COMPILING IT GIVES VERSION ERROR, EITHER UPDATE OR BOOTLEG IT BY GOING INTO THE .json AND MODIFYING THE VERSION
